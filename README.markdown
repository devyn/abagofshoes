# a Bag Of Shoes

## What is this bag of yours?

In here I will keep all my little [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) apps, that way I won't clutter GitHub with hundreds of repositories for every tiny little app I develop. They are all licensed under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file accompanying this bag), so you can use parts of them in your own applications or just change them to your hearts desire. Feel free to suggest code improvements. Usually my code sucks, but at least it works.

## What kind of apps are they?

A few will be just useless stuff to try out Shoes, but some will be (hopefully useful) old scripts I wrote, wrapped into a Shoes app so that they get a GUI.

## What do I need to run them?

Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux plus a free copy of [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes).

## How do I run them?

Start [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) and it will ask you for a file to open. Pick the something.rb file that you want to run and the app will start.

As soon as the Shoes packager is working I'll provide pre-packaged versions of all the apps in the bag for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X on my website, then you'll be able to just double click on an icon to start one of the apps.

## That one Shoe in the bag doesn't work!

Update: September 18th 2008
I've not done anything Shoes related for about a month, there where quite some big changes in Shoes so a few of the apps don't work anymore. I'll get back to Shoes some time this week to make the apps work again and to make them use the new Shoes features, especially the now in Shoes included threaded downloading.

Shoes is in constant development and sometimes changes break apps. Another possibility for these apps not working could be that I was too lazy to test them on more than one or two platforms. I do have access to Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, so it's really lazyness :)

Just comment on an app that's not working and I'll look into it. Mention which version of Shoes you are using and which platform you are on.
