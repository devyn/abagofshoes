# a Bag Of Shoes

## What is this bag of yours?

In here I will keep all my little [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) apps, that way I won't clutter GitHub with hundreds of repositories for every tiny little app I develop. They are all licensed under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file accompanying this bag), so you can use parts of them in your own applications or just change them to your hearts desire. Feel free to suggest code improvements. Usually my code sucks, but at least it works.

## What kind of apps are they?

A few will be just useless stuff to try out Shoes, but some will be (hopefully useful) old scripts I wrote, wrapped into a Shoes app so that they get a GUI.

## What do I need to run them?

Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux plus a free copy of [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes).

## How do I run them?

Start [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) and it will ask you for a file to open. Pick the something.rb file that you want to run and the app will start.

As soon as the Shoes packager is working I'll provide pre-packaged versions of all the apps in the bag for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X on my website, then you'll be able to just double click on an icon to start one of the apps.

## That one Shoe in the bag doesn't work!

Shoes apps behave differently on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. Most of the apps are tested only on Mac OS X, so if something doesn't run on Windows or Linux it's a bug in Shoes that should be fixed soon.

Just comment on an app that's not working and I'll look into it. Mention which version of Shoes you are using and which platform you are on.
