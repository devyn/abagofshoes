# a Bag Of Shoes

## What is this bag of yours?

In here I will keep all my little [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) apps, that way I won't clutter GitHub with hundreds of repositories for every tiny little app I develop. They are all licensed under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file accompanying this bag), so you can use parts of them in your own applications or just change them to your hearts desire. Feel free to suggest code improvements. Usually my code sucks, but at least it works.

## What kind of apps are they?

A few will be just useless stuff to try out Shoes, but some will be (hopefully useful) old scripts I wrote, wrapped into a Shoes app so that they get a GUI.

## What do I need to run them?

Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux plus a free copy of [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes).

## How do I run them?

Start [Shoes](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) and it will ask you for a file to open. Pick the something.rb file that you want to run and the app will start.

As soon as the Shoes packager is working I'll provide pre-packaged versions of all the apps in the bag for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X on my website, then you'll be able to just double click on an icon to start one of the apps.

## That one Shoe in the bag doesn't work!

At the top of every Shoes app in the bag is a huge chunk of comments. In there you will find a section called "Status", which tells you if the app is in a working state and if so, what doesn't work yet.

If it lies and says it works but it isn't working, then something really is wrong and I'll gladly give you a refund. Oh wait, the bag is free, isn't it? Sorry, you're out of luck then. Be sure to send me your changes when you fix the app though and I'll add them to the bag (if the changes are sane that is, but it's not that hard to be more sane than me).

# Bag contents:

## Chatlog Viewer

Displays aMSN and Mercury chatlogs. Can also convert them to a nicely formatted HTML file.

## Guess My Number

It's a game! Try to guess a number from 1 to 100. The only help you get is the computer telling you if the number you entered is too low or too high.
